#### Payment Card Validation Class
This is a basic implementation of the Luhn Algorithm in PHP. The Luhn Algorithm is used to validate things like credit cards and national identification numbers.

I have added a few basic PHPSpec tests in the spec folder. I am treating this project as a kata and I am therefore aiming to improve this class over time.
